# Initial Version

Good starting background documentation:

- https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/
- https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/
- https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/custom_tools/#tool-decorator

# project setup for beginners

- git clone (with commit)
- howto install dependencies
- howto setup .env

# our starting situation

- having some SSH code from hackingbuddyGPT
- code from the different langchain-examples

# the first prototype

- move SSH code into separate SSH file
- implement a simple manually-written version

# TODO

- the root check does not work!
- maybe switch tool to tool-base class
- config handling could be cleaner
